## About me

_I'm 39, I want to radically change the field of activity. And since my hobby was to learn something new, I decided to try my hand at layout. In my very humble opinion, the layout was given to me. Now it's the turn for JS, I really want not only to know DOMElement, but also to be able to write programs._

_He took basic courses in layout (CSS, HTML, JS), SEO and Internet marketing. 
I got most of my knowledge by studying on my own._

_I'm trying to work as a freelancer._

## Code example
###### The code for working with the modal window, tracking the click on the element and then changing styles. Probably the easiest thing to work with DOM.

```
const contactBtn = document.querySelector('.contact'),
      listContact = document.querySelector('.contact__my');

if (contactBtn){
    contactBtn.addEventListener("click", function () {
        listContact.classList.toggle('open');
    })
}
if (listContact) {
    listContact.addEventListener("click", function () {
        listContact.classList.remove('open');
